# README

This project is a quick build of a fairly 'stock' HTML, CSS website, no JS.

It's nothing fancy,but it's useful as an introductory template for
new developers to start learning the basics of web development.

Primarily built for the submission to the Holberton School entrance project,

Project is/was run on a Ubuntu 24.04 server (So that means use of `apt` package manager).
The project (or rather the scripts) are setup with that expectation in mind.

## Files

The `setup.sh` file is to handle the install and personal setup, on a remote server.
It includes: 

- Aliases (personal mostly), and adds them to `.bashrc`
- Package installs (neovim, htop)

Note that the installer checks if the programs are already installed,
