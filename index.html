    Welcome to My First Webpage

  <p>
    Today we will be talking about why Rust is a better programming language than many others,
    in particular, I will be picking on C for this discussion.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Why Rust is better than C for teaching people programming.
  </h2>
  <p>
    Rust offers memory safety without a garbage collector, making it easier for beginners to understand memory
    management concepts.
    Its modern syntax and powerful tooling also enhance the learning experience compared to C.
    By extension of this it also ensures students are forced to learn good programming practices from the start, because
    Rust simply will not compile code that has common mistakes that early learners often make.

    Cool I guess? But what about that whole borrow checker thing, I heard it can be hard for beginners.
  </h3>
  <p>
    Alright I hear you, everyone talks about how scary the borrow checker is.
    While yes, it is a new concept for many people, it is also a very powerful tool that helps prevent common
    programming errors.
    Having the compiler encofrce these rules, especially for beginners, can lead to a deeper of common memory related
    issues (ie: bugs - use after free, double free, etc).
    The feedback that the compiler provides when borrow rules are violated can be very educational, helping learners
    understand the importance of ownership and lifetimes in programming.
    Although the language concept of lifetimes may not exist in C/++, they do exist in terms of concepts and are often
    talked about in terms of scope and variable lifetime, Rust simply
    introduced a syntax aware language feature to help manage and, more importantly, enforce these concepts.

    All this and not even a mention of the current industry trend of adopting Rust for everything from
    systems programming through to web development. You can build operating systems, game engines, web servers, and
    even general use Command Line Interface (CLI) tools with Rust.
    Oh, building Desktop Applications is possible too! That is absolutely right - no bundling electron and 1.1GB of Node
    goodness anymore.
