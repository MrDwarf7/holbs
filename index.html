        Welcome to My First Webpage
      </h1>
      <p>
        Today we will be talking about why Rust is a better programming language than many others,
        in particular; I'll be picking on C for this discussion.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Why Rust is better than C for teaching people programming.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Rust offers memory safety without a garbage collector, making it easier for beginners to understand memory
        management concepts.
        <br>
        Its modern syntax and powerful tooling also enhance the learning experience compared to C.
        By extension of this it also ensures students are forced to learn good programming practices from the start,
        because Rust simply will not compile code that has common mistakes that early learners often make.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Cool I guess? But what about that whole borrow checker thing, I heard it can be hard for beginners.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Alright I hear you, everyone talks about how scary the borrow checker is.
        While yes, it is a new concept for many people, it is also a very powerful tool that helps prevent common
        programming errors. Ones you may run into are then also moved to compile time rather than runtime.
        (I don't have to see "SEGV" faults anymore thanks to Rust! Massive 'W' on that.)
        <br>
        Having the compiler encofrce these rules, especially for beginners, can lead to a deeper of common memory
        related issues (ie: bugs - use after free, double free, etc).
        <br>
        The feedback that the compiler provides when borrow rules are violated can be very educational, helping learners
        understand the importance of ownership and lifetimes in programming.
        Although the language concept of lifetimes may not exist in C/++; they do exist concepts in textbooks and are
        often talked about in terms of scope and variable lifetime.
        <br>
        Rust simply introduces a syntax aware language feature to help manage and, more importantly, enforce these
        same concepts.
      </p>


      <p>
        All this and not even a mention of the current industry trend of adopting Rust for everything from
        systems programming through to web development. You can build operating systems, game engines, web servers, and
        even general use Command Line Interface (CLI) tools with Rust.
        <br>
        Oh, building Desktop Applications is possible too! That is absolutely right - no bundling electron and 1.1GB of
        Node goodness anymore.

        This is Ferris, the Rust mascot, he's a cool crab fella.
        Look at him, observe his magestic nature. Becoem inspired by Ferris and start your Rust journey today!
        Enjoy never seeing a segmentation fault again.
        Becoem a Rustacean today; for modern programming without the fear of undefined behavior.
